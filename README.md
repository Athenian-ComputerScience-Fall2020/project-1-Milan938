# Project 1


An idea I had for my project is a game that gives you hints about past presidents and you have to guess which president it is within a certain number of guesses. 

The computer randomly picks a number, with a different number assigned to each president. The code then
takes the user through all the hihnts and guesses that they need, either ending in a win or loss for the user. 

Use the preview tab at the top to see how it looks. You can edit directly in GitHub or in Gitpod. Be careful not to edit in GitHub while Gitpod is open or you may have version conflicts.
